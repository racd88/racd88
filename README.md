👋 Hi, I'm Roger Chavarría!

👀 I'm interested in merging the rhythm of salsa dancing with the logic of data science! My heart beats for coding in R Studio and exploring the fascinating world of political data analysis.

🌱 I'm currently learning machine learning techniques to revolutionize public policy, diving deep into network analysis, and discovering new ways to make data-driven decisions that matter.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on applied data projects that make a difference - from crafting compelling political communication visualizations to conducting rigorous impact evaluations. Let's use data to shape better policies!

Based in the monster Mexico City 🇲🇽

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I traded the paradise beaches of Playa del Carmen for the urban jungle of CDMX, but my heart still dances to the Caribbean rhythm! When I'm not crunching numbers, you might find me perfecting my salsa moves or dreaming up new ways to visualize political data.
